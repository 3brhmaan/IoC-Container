# Simple Simulation Of The IoC Container Operation using Reflection ðŸ“¦
    IoC Container used to provide Dependencies to whoever asks for it 

## Features ðŸ’¡: 
1. **Registering Dependencies** using Contract/interface and Implementation
2. **Resolving the implementation** using the contract/interface
3. Supporting **Constructor injection** with the required dependencies 
4. Registering Unbound dependency aka **Open Generic Types** and resolving the required **Closed Generic Types** with the required **type arguments** the Generic types needs
